# Python for DevOps - How to automate top 5 common operations with New Relic NerdGraph

As you start to instrument more apps and hosts with New Relic One, you’ll likely want to perform common administrative tasks within the platform such as auditing your instrumented services and exporting telemetry data. You can perform these tasks via the prebuilt UI or you can automate them through the Nerdgraph API. In this guide, we’ll show you how to use Python to automate the following operations:

- Audit your instrumented services.
- Manage your tags.
- Export telemetry for data analysis.
- Export dashboards as files.
- Rotate your license keys.
